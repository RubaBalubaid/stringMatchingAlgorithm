# String Matching Algorithm
The project aims to implement and compare the efficiency of three string matching algorithms—Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS), and the Naive algorithm—using three different data structures: List, Hash Table, and Linked List. The goal is to determine which combination of algorithm and data structure provides the best performance in terms of speed, memory usage, and ease of implementation.

### Algorithms:

- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm:** A more efficient string matching algorithm that avoids unnecessary comparisons by utilizing partial match information.
- **Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) Algorithm:** Often used in conjunction with KMP, this algorithm preprocesses the pattern to create a longest prefix suffix array, enhancing the string matching process.
- **Naive Algorithm:** A straightforward and easy-to-understand approach that checks for the pattern at every possible position in the text.

### Data Structures:

- **List:** A dynamic array that provides quick access to elements but may have performance drawbacks with frequent insertions or deletions.
- **Hash Table:** An associative array that allows for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions but requires a good hash function to minimize collisions.
- **Linked List:** A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes connected by pointers, offering flexibility in memory usage but slower access times compared to arrays.
